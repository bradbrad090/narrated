# Deployment Documentation Audit

## Current State (Last Updated: October 2025)

### Active Deployment Documents

#### 1. **deployment.md** ✅ CURRENT
- **Status**: Up-to-date and comprehensive
- **Covers**:
  - Lovable/Supabase deployment flow
  - Frontend deployment via Lovable's publish feature
  - Edge functions auto-deployment
  - Environment variables setup
  - Database migrations
  - Authentication configuration
  - Troubleshooting and common issues
- **Accuracy**: Reflects current infrastructure (Lovable + Supabase)
- **Action**: None needed - this is the primary deployment reference

#### 2. **NARRATED_MVP_REFERENCE.md** ⚠️ HISTORICAL
- **Status**: Historical planning document
- **Purpose**: Was a detailed implementation guide for Tasks 1-4 (PDF generation system)
- **Current Relevance**: 
  - PDF generation infrastructure exists but is incomplete
  - Contains valuable technical patterns but not current deployment instructions
  - May reference outdated approaches (e.g., Vercel-specific details vs Lovable deployment)
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Keep as historical reference in a `/docs/archive/` folder
  - Not a deployment guide - it's a feature implementation guide
  - Consider marking with "HISTORICAL REFERENCE" banner at top

### Deployment Process (Current)

The actual deployment process is now simplified through Lovable:

1. **Frontend Deployment**:
   - Click "Publish" button in Lovable
   - Automatic build and deployment
   - No manual Vercel configuration needed

2. **Backend Deployment**:
   - Edge functions auto-deploy with code changes
   - Database migrations via Supabase CLI or Lovable integration
   - Secrets managed through Lovable/Supabase dashboards

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Set via Lovable project settings
   - Supabase secrets for edge functions
   - No need for separate Vercel configuration

### Document Recommendations

1. **Keep**: `deployment.md` - Primary deployment reference
2. **Update**: Remove references to Vercel from `deployment.md` if Lovable is the deployment platform
3. **Archive**: Move `NARRATED_MVP_REFERENCE.md` to `/docs/archive/` with clear "Historical Reference" label
4. **Verify**: Ensure `deployment.md` accurately reflects Lovable deployment process

### Infrastructure Notes

- **Hosting**: Lovable (not Vercel) for frontend
- **Backend**: Supabase for database, auth, edge functions, storage
- **Edge Functions**: Auto-deployed via Git push or Supabase CLI
- **No Custom Servers**: Fully serverless architecture
- **Scaling**: Automatic via Lovable and Supabase infrastructure

### Outdated References to Remove

From `deployment.md` if present:
- Specific Vercel dashboard instructions (unless still using Vercel)
- Manual build/deploy commands for frontend (Lovable handles this)
- References to `npm run build` for deployment (development only)

### Critical Deployment Paths

1. **Code Changes**:
   - Push to main branch
   - Lovable auto-deploys frontend
   - Edge functions auto-deploy

2. **Database Changes**:
   - Create migration via Supabase CLI
   - Test locally
   - Push migration to remote via `supabase db push`

3. **Secrets**:
   - Add via Lovable project settings (frontend)
   - Add via Supabase secrets management (backend)

## Summary

**Primary deployment documentation is in good shape.** The main action item is to verify that `deployment.md` accurately reflects the current Lovable-based deployment process rather than Vercel-specific instructions. `NARRATED_MVP_REFERENCE.md` should be treated as a historical feature implementation guide, not a deployment manual.
