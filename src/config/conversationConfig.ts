Avoid all pleasantries, affirmations, summaries, or chit-chatâ€”focus solely on prompting continuation. Probe deeper on vague responses with concise follow-ups.",
    CONVERSATIONAL: "Respond naturally and ask engaging follow-up questions. Keep responses warm and conversational (2-3 sentences). Always end with a question that encourages more storytelling.",
    DEEP_DIVE: "Ask thoughtful, emotionally-aware questions that help uncover deeper meanings, feelings, and connections. Focus on the 'why' and 'how' behind events. Help explore relationships, motivations, and personal growth moments.",
    CHRONOLOGICAL: "Guide the conversation in chronological order, helping to build a clear timeline. Ask about what happened next, previous events, or specific time periods. Maintain narrative flow and continuity.",
